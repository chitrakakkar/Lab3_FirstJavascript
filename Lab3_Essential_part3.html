                    <p><b>Synopsis:</b><strong>Back to the Future</strong> is a 1985 American science-fiction adventure comedy film[5] directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. It stars Michael J. Fox as teenager Marty McFly, who is sent back in time to 1955, where he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother's romantic interest. Christopher Lloyd portrays the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown, Marty's friend who helps him repair the damage to history by helping Marty cause his parents to fall in love. Marty and Doc must also find a way to return Marty to 1985.

                        Zemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale mused upon whether he would have befriended his father if they had attended school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice for the role of Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film.

                        <p><b>Synopsis:</b><strong>Deadpool</strong> is a 2016 American superhero film directed by Tim Miller and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is the eighth installment in the X-Men film series, and stars Ryan Reynolds as the title character, as well as Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Gina Carano, Leslie Uggams, Brianna Hildebrand, and Stefan Kapičić. In the film, antihero Deadpool hunts the man who nearly destroyed his life while also trying to reunite with his lost love.

                            Development began in February 2004 with New Line Cinema, but moved in March 2005 to 20th Century Fox who bought the film rights. In May 2009, after Reynolds portrayed the character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, to the general disappointment of fans, Fox lent the film to writers, and Miller was hired for his directorial debut in April 2011. Additional casting began in early 2015, and principal photography commenced in Vancouver from March to May.

                            Deadpool premiered in Paris on February 8, 2016, and was released on February 12 in the United States in IMAX, DLP, D-Box, and premium large format. Critics praised Reynolds' performance as well as the film's style, faithful depiction of the titular character, and action sequences, but criticized its plot as formulaic.
